# The Y-2-Kepler

The Y-2 Kepler (Y2K) is a project built at YHack, a hackathon hosted at Yale University. You can view the ChallengePost project [here](http://challengepost.com/software/the-y-2-kepler). Y2K runs on the Intel Gallileo to keep track of changes in your home environment as it welcomes you home.

## What Y2K can currently do

- Detects temperature
- Alerts end user of abnormal temperatures (<= X or >= Y)
- Light sensors allows LCD to go dim when lights are off or light up when lights are on
- Allows the end user to generate a series of notes that can be played back upon turning on the lights
